<sub>Note: This was a very hacky solution, and I'm sure Google will probably patch it soon (especially if a lot of people find out about this extension). Enjoy it while it lasts! I'll look into making this more robust and figuring out if there's a more permanent solution, but wanted to just get this out there. Didn't put this in the Chrome Web Store for obvious reasons. @Google let me know if you want me to take this down.</sub>
